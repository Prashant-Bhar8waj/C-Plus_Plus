* In c++, we have two different types of files, compilation file or the translation unit and than we also have a header file:
    * They're used for much more than just to
    kind of declare certain declarations
    that you want to use in multiple CPP
    files 

    * Header files are used to declare certain type of functions so they can be used throughout your program. We need certain declarations to actually exist so that we know what functions and types are available to us.
    * for example if we create a function in one file and we want to use that function in another file, C++ never gonna know that function even exists, when we compile that file. So, we need just one place to kind of store just declarations not definations.

main.cpp
```c++
#include <iostream>

void Log(const char* message)
{
    std::cout << message << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
 
    Log("Hello World!");
    std::cin.get();
}
```
log.cpp
```c++
void InitLog()
    {
        Log("Initializing Log")
    }
```

* In the log.cpp, it doesn't know anything about the log function, which is actually present in the main.cpp file. So if i hit f7 and compile the log.cpp, it gives an error. So as far as log.cpp concerned Log funciton doesn't exists.
* so what does log.cpp needs in order to not show error. How do we tell it that log function does actually exists but its just defined elsewhere that is where a funtion declaration comes in 

log.cpp
```c++

void Log(const char* message); // Function signature

void InitLog()
    {
        Log("Initializing Log")
    }
```

* The point that it doesn't actually have body means that it is the declaration of the function. So we found a way to tell log.cpp that my log function exists somewhere but  what I make another file that needs to use this log function does that mean I also have to copy and paste this void log declaration everywhere. The answer is Yes, you do actually need to do that. 
* However, there is way to make that easier, header files - header files are files that get included in the Cpp file. so bascially what we do is copy and paste the contents of the header file into the cpp file and we do that via the `#include` directors. so #include has the capability to copy and paste files into other files.

log.h
```c++
#pragma once
void log(const char * message);
```

* If I paste any declaration into the header file  log.h, I can include everywhere where I want to be able to use log and it will copy and paste this everywhere throughout every file that require it.

* what is `#pragma once`, so first thing is anything that begins with the # is know as the preprocessor command, it means it is going to evaluated by the c++ preprocessor before this file actually gets compiled. `pragma` is essentially an instruction that is sent to the compiler or to the preprocessor and what pragma means is that only include this file once, it prevents us including the single header file multiple times into a single translation unit

---
- With header guides we
have this kind of discrepancy between
include statements, some include
statements use "" quotes some include
statements use <> angular brackets what is
the deal? :
    - They mean two different things, when we compile our program, we have the ability to tell the compiler of certain include part, these are bascially part of two folders in our computer that conatined include files 
    - If the include file that we want to include is inside one of these folders we can use angular brackets to tell the compiler to search our include past folders where as `quotes` on the other hand are usually used to include files that are relative to the current files. for example if had a file called log.h up one derictory form this currrent log.cpp directory file, I could use "../"
    ```c++
    #include "../log.h"
    ```
    to go back, that would go back because that is relative to this current file.
    - whereas with this angular brackets there are never relative to this current file, they just have to be one the include directory.

- isostream does not contains any extension, this was just who so ever did this just bascially wanted to seperate the C standard library header file and c++ standard library header files.
- the c standard library often have a `.h` extension.
```c++
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <iostream>
```
