# 1. Variables 

Variables basically allow us to name a piece of data that we store in memory so that we can keep using it as an example pretend that you're making a game and you've got a player in your game and that player character has some kind of position on the map and the player character can move so we need to be able to store the player's position as some kind of variable in our memory so that when it comes time to draw the player on the screen or interact with the rest of the level, we can actually see hey where on earth is the player so we would want to store the players position in a variable this is basically one of the fundamentals of writing a program in any language. we need to be able to play with data and store that data somewhere.

-  In C++ were given a
bunch of primitive data types
these primitive data types essentially
form the building blocks of any kind of
data we store in our program each data
type that C++ gives us has a
specific purpose.

- The only distinction between the
different variable types you have in
Super Plus is the size how much memory
does this variable occupy when it comes
down to it
really the only difference between these
primitive data types how big are they.

## 1.1 int
int in stands
for integer and it lets us store an
integer in a given range if we want to
declare a brand new variable we can do
so by typing the type of the variable
giving it some kind of name for example
variable and then giving it a value, this last part is optional you don't
have to give it a value immediately but
for now let's just give it the value
eight.
- An integer is the data type that
is traditionally four bytes
large the actual size of a data type
depends on the compiler so it may be
different depending on what compiler
you're using ultimately it's the
compilers choice to tell you how big your data is going to be the int data
type is meant for storing integers in a
certain range because it's four bytes
large we are limited as to what kind of
numbers we can store with it
specifically this is something called a
signed integer that can store a value of
around negative 2 billion to positive
2 billion, anything larger or smaller
than that is going to require more data to store than this int actually supports.
```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int variable = 8;

    std::cout << variable << std::endl;
    std::cin.get();
}
```
- where are these limits coming
from do they make any sense and the
answer is yes they make sense they are
directly tied with the size of the
variable that is how much data were
allowed to store in it an integer is 4
bytes 

- 1 bytes = 8 bits data; which means
- 4 bytes = 32 bits

- Because this variable is signed meaning
it can be negative, it contains a sign
like a negative sign because this
variable is signed one of those bits one
of those 32 bits has to be for the sign.
So, that we know if it's positive or
negative. Which only leaves 31 bits left
for the actual number, now a bit can
either be 0 or 1. So, there are 2 possible
values for 1 bit of data so using a
little bit of maths here we can say that
we have 31 bits to play with 2 possible
values per bit so what is 2 to the
power of 31, we would get about 2.1 billion. This is the maximum number we can store.

- But If I don't want to use the neagtive values, is there a way to just get rid of that one bit being for the neagtive sign and just use that bit as a part of my number. So, Yes, there is way, that is called the unsigned number that does not have a sign. In c++, we can make those just by typing `unsigned` infront of the integer. so now what we've done is we have 32 bits to play with. And 2 to the power of 32, is double of what we had before.
```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    unsigned int variable = 8;

    std::cout << variable << std::endl;
    std::cin.get();
}
```

AND what other datatypes are available to us:

- we have got `char` which is 1 byte of data.
- `short` which is 2 bytes of data.
- `int` which is 4 bytes of data.
- `long` which is also 4 bytes of data.
- `long long` which is usually 8 bytes of data.

 you can also add sign to any of these, and it will remove that sign bit and let you set a larger number.

 - `char` traditionally is
also used for storing characters not
just numbers so below I'm assigning
numbers to it like 50 you can also
assign characters to it like.
```c++ 
int main()
{
    char a = 50;
    char c = "A";
}
```

- If I want to store a decimal value for
example 5.5, how do I do that,
well for that we have two data types we
have `float` and we
have `double` 

```c++ 
int main()
{
    float variable = 5.5f;
    double var = 5.5;

    std::cout << variable << std::endl;
    std::cin.get();
}
```
- how do we discern between what a double is
and what a float is, The way we do that
is by basically appending an F to our
float variables it can be lowercase or
uppercase doesn't matter but the point
is if we have an F you can see that
we've actually declared a float. So,
floats are basically four bytes large
and doubles are eight bytes large

Another datatype is boolean and it can either be True or False. 

```c++ 
int main()
{
    bool variable = true;

    std::cout << variable << std::endl;
    std::cin.get();
}
```

- So basically zero means
false and anything except zero any other
number means true 

- bool datatype occupy 1 byte of memory, But why 1 byte, because when we store the bool in the memory there is no way to address individual 1 bit, we can only address byte. However, you can be smart and store 8 bools in 1 byte.  

- But is there a way we can check the size of these datatypes

```c++ 
int main()
{
    bool variable = true;

    std::cout << sizeof(bool) << std::endl;
    std::cin.get();
} 
```
