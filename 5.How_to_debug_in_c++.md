* There are two main parts of debugging:
    * Breakpoints 
    * looking at the memory 

Debug means to remove bugs form our code 

- Breakpoint is a point in our program at which the debugger will break. We can set a breakpoint in any line our program and when the execution hits that line it will pause. And we can take a look at what is going on in its memory, memory is
what variable is set to, what funciton will be called next, being able to view memory is useful in diagnosing what the issue is with your program because by viewing the memory you can see what every variable is set to and be like Hey! this variable shouldn't be set to this value. Something is wrong.

- One thing to notice is that if you are debugging, make sure you are in the debugging mode
