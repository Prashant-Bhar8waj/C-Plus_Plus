# 1. Functions 
functions are basically blocks of code that we write that are designed to perform a specific task later when we get to classes those blocks are called methods.

- Functions is having an input and an output although they don't necessarily need to. We can provide the function with certain parameters and the function can return a value for us.
- Suppose that we wanted to multiply two numbers together and we wanted to write a function.
- Something which I will write, is called return value, that is the type that this function will return. So, multiplying 2 integers together will result in an Integer. So, our return type is going to be `int`. 

```c++
#include <iostream>

int Multiply(int a, int b)
{
    reuturn a*b;
}
```
- we could also tell the function to not return anything, and we do this by giving the return type `void` which means nothing.

```c++
#include <iostream>

void Multiply()
{
    std::cout << 5*7 << std::endl;
}
```

- And how do we call this function.
```c++
#include <iostream>

int Multiply(int a, int b)
{
    reuturn a*b;
}

int main()
{
    int result = Multiply(3,2);
    std::cout << result << std::endl;
    std::cin.get();
}
```

```c++
#include <iostream>

int Multiply(int a, int b)
{
    reuturn a*b;
}

int main()
{
    int result1 = Multiply(3,2);
    std::cout << result1 << std::endl;

    int result2 = Multiply(7,5);
    std::cout << result2 << std::endl;

    int result3 = Multiply(22,92);
    std::cout << result3 << std::endl;

    std::cin.get();
}
```
- Instead of doing this we can just do it defining the void funtion which returns nothing and we don't have to type to type the unnecessary code.

```c++
#include <iostream>

int Multiply(int a, int b)
{
    reuturn a*b;
}
void MultiplyAndLog(int a, int b)
{
    int result = Multiply(a, b);
    std::cout << result << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    MultiplyAndLog(3,2);
    MultiplyAndLog(7,5);
    MultiplyAndLog(22,92);
    std::cin.get();
}
```
- A little bit odd about this main
function, it says that it's return value
is int however the return keyword is
nowhere to be found and we're obviously
not returning anything so if I specify a
return value do I actually need to
return something.

- Do functions with the return type
actually need to return values? The
answer is yes they do, the main function
is actually a special function the main
function and only the main function is
exempt from this kind of must return a
value, if you don't specify a return
value it will automatically assume that
you're returning zero.
